description: |-
  The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering  recognizes that students have a variety of career objectives. Some enter industry directly in an engineering capacity and some continue their studies in graduate school in engineering or applied science. Other MAE graduates pursue careers in business, law or medicine. The department offers sufficient flexibility to students planning an undergraduate program that meets any of these objectives and guides them to build fundamental knowledge in key engineering disciplines and develop practical skills in problem-solving and design. The subjects of solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, dynamics, control systems, materials and applied mathematics, combined with the experience of engineering design, are the core of the department's curriculum. Both the mechanical and aerospace engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.

  explanation: |
    Requirements for study in the department follow the general requirements for the School of Engineering and Applied Science. In addition, the following four courses and one laboratory are normally completed by departmental students before entry into the junior year.
    Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
    206 Introduction to Engineering Dynamics
    221 Thermodynamics
    222 Mechanics of Fluids
    223 Modern Solid Mechanics
    224 Integrated Engineering Science Laboratory
    Some of the above can be satisfied by equivalent courses. For example, students with an interest in structures may take CEE 205 Mechanics of Solids in place of MAE 223; and students with an interest in engineering physics may take PHY 205 Classical Mechanics or PHY 207 Mechanics and Waves in place of MAE 206.
    Each departmental student will be introduced to instrumentation and computer-based data acquisition in the MAE 224 laboratory.

  explanation: |-
    Senior Independent Work is the culminating experience for the mechanical and aerospace
    engineering programs. All seniors are required to participate in a research or engineering
    project. All projects must include elements of engineering design (engineering design is the
    process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs). The following
    courses satisfy this requirement: MAE 439 Senior Independent Work (one semester, fall);
    MAE 440 Senior Independent Work (one semester, spring); MAE 442 Senior Thesis (yearlong);
    MAE 444 Senior Project (year-long). Students are strongly encouraged to select
    the year-long project or thesis option. Senior projects are intended for teams or groups
    while senior thesis is intended for individuals. For senior project or thesis, work begins in
    the fall but enrollment is only in spring term when a double grade is awarded. Please note:
    If a student has selected to participate in a year-long project or thesis and is enrolled in only
    three courses during the fall semester, it is required that they will enroll in Senior Project or
    Thesis during the spring semester. For these students, it will NOT be possible to drop-down
    to a one-semester course of Independent Work without incurring a failure for Independent
    Work in the fall term. In Spring term you must enroll in three courses plus senior thesis or
    senior project (senior thesis and senior project count as two courses). Therefore your senior
    year course load will be 3 in fall and 5 in spring as opposed to 4 in fall and 4 in spring.
    There are NO exceptions to this rule even if your total number of courses will exceed 36.
