description: |-
  Geosciences is a unique blend of lab experiments, field observation, data analysis and computer modeling. Courses in geosciences apply principles of biology, chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics to real Earth problems, deal with length scales from global to atomic and consider timescales from billions of years to less than a second. The flexible academic program allows students to develop individualized courses of study.

    The major in geosciences requires 14 courses. In addition to the three prerequisites and the statistics requirement, each specialization in the geosciences major requires four core math and science requirements, two core GEO requirements and four GEO electives. The particular requirements are determined by the student's track of study.

  explanation: |-
    In addition to these courses, the Junior Colloquium is a weekly luncheon meeting, convened during the fall term, to teach juniors basic techniques in proposal writing and analytical computing. This one-hour colloquium is mandatory for all geosciences majors.
    All juniors are required to conduct independent research in both the fall and spring terms. Each term, this work includes a written progress report, final written report and a poster presentation of the student's final JP work.  Faculty members will evaluate student poster presentations and submit feedback and grades. Although geoengineers are not required to conduct JP research, some geoengineers have conducted independent research in geosciences or engineering for course credit.

- name: Senior Thesis
  min_needed: 1
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |-
    The senior research thesis project involves a more in-depth study in the chosen topic and is a full-year effort. Students should budget their time accordingly. Each geosciences senior will choose an appropriate faculty member as their senior thesis adviser in consultation with the departmental adviser and the faculty members who support the student's interests. The student is expected to conduct research in the adviser's laboratory and work closely with the adviser and/or graduate students/postdoctoral fellows.

    The comprehensive examination in the department consists of an oral examination based on the senior thesis and related topics.
