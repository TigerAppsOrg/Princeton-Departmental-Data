description: |-
  The Department of Art and Archaeology is devoted to the study of the visual arts and the investigation of material artifacts from a wide range of cultures and periods. Students may pursue a major in the History of Art or the Practice of Art; information on the certificate in Archaeology is also included below. Studio art courses are taught by faculty in the Program in Visual Arts; history of art courses also frequently include practical components. Students interested in the practice of art (taught by faculty in the Program in Visual Arts) can pursue a major in the department. Working closely with faculty members in small classes and often dealing directly with original objects and primary sources, students can explore subjects as diverse as Roman or modern city planning, arts of printing and book-making in East Asia or Europe, ancient or medieval archaeology, architectural history, 19th-21st century photography and contemporary arts of Africa, Latin America and the United States.

        A total of 10 courses in the Department of Art and Archaeology, including ART 400 (Junior Seminar) and an additional two seminars at the 400- or 500-level. Seven of the 10 courses must be taught by Art and Archaeology departmental faculty. Students must take at least one course in each of the following three distribution areas: Group 1 (ancient), Group 2 (medieval/early modern), and Group 3 (19th century to the present).  ART 100, ART 400 and ART 401 count as departmentals but not as distribution courses. In choosing courses to satisfy requirements, students are encouraged to explore a range of geographies and a range of media, e.g., architecture, painting, sculpture, photography, works on paper, film.
        No more than two cognate courses taken in other departments (including the Program in Visual Arts) may be counted toward the 10 departmentals. This includes summer courses. Students participating in the Study Abroad Program may be allowed to count more than two courses taken overseas as departmentals. All cognate courses must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies prior to enrollment, based on the submission of a syllabus and course description. Courses cross-listed with the Department of Art and Archaeology automatically count as departmentals, but do not count toward the departmental honors GPA.

        During the fall of junior year, all majors must take the junior seminar (ART 400). The course introduces students to various methods used by art historians and archaeologists, and many assignments relate directly to their junior independent work. Students who are abroad during the fall of junior year can complete the junior seminar during the fall term of their senior year.

        Junior Independent Work (JIW) begins in the fall, in the context of the junior seminar (ART 400), and continues into the spring with a faculty adviser whom the student selects in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. JIW consists of a research paper of approximately 30-40 pages (7,500-10,000 words) on any topic related to visual and material culture. Assignments in ART 400 help students conceptualize and implement their research agendas. The JIW requirement in History of Art includes two colloquia with the Practice of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.

      explanation: |-
        The senior independent work consists of a year-long research project of approximately 60-80 pages (15,000-20,000 words). The student selects a faculty adviser in the spring of their junior year and submits a progress report to the director of undergraduate studies by mid-November of their senior year. For further deadlines see the Undergraduate Handbook; for further details on thesis writing and research, see the Independent Work Guide in the History of Art. The thesis grade is the average of the grades given by the faculty adviser and a second faculty reader. The Senior Independent Work requirement in History of Art includes two colloquia with the Practice of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.

        The senior departmental examination  in the Practice of Arts has two parts. (1) A one-hour critical discussion (the “Crit”) of the senior thesis exhibition in the latter half of the spring term, in the presence of each student's exhibition. The discussion is open to all Program in Visual Arts faculty and Practice of Art/certificate students. All Visual Arts faculty who attend the Crit will grade it, and those grades will be averaged. (2) Practice of Art students participate in the same comprehensive exam ("Comps") as the History of Art students (see above). The VIS primary adviser and the ART adviser will be two of the three faculty present at the comprehensive exam; the three grades will be averaged for the Comps grade. The final grade on the transcript for the departmental examination is the average of the Crit grade and the Comps grade.

            During the fall of junior year, all majors must take the junior seminar, VIS 392 Issues in Contemporary Art. Beginning with the Class of 2023, film students will also be required to take VIS 392. VIS 392 coincides with admission to the junior studios and investigates the history, challenges and rewards of studio practice. Through readings, discussions, studio critiques and a culminating exhibition of works in progress, VIS 392 provides the foundation for students' independent creative development, as well as the impetus for beginning to be able to articulate the historical precedents and ambitions of their work. Students are also strongly encouraged to take ART 400, the junior methods seminar in the Department of Art and Archaeology.

        Junior independent work begins in the fall, in the context of the junior seminar. It continues into the spring in partnership with two faculty advisers, one from VIS and one from ART. Students are provided with studio space and prepare independent work over the course of the year, culminating in an exhibition as part of the Spring Junior Group Thesis Show. Film students work throughout their junior year to create a junior film.
        All Practice of Art juniors assemble a writing portfolio consisting of multiple short essays amounting to approximately 10 pages (2,500 words). The essays reflect on the creating process and discuss the relation of the work to the student's broader studies, especially in art history. The essays should include a bibliography. The grade for independent work is the average of the grade from the VIS and ART advisers. For further description of the portfolios, see the Undergraduate Handbook.

        By the end of the second week of the fall term of senior year, students must have three advisers, including one from the Department of Art and Archaeology faculty, who is selected in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. The senior independent work is a major studio project completed by the end of the spring term, done in consultation with the student's advisers, and a writing portfolio consisting of multiple short essays amounting to approximately 20 pages (5,000 words). The essays reflect on the creating process and discuss the relation of the work to the student's broader studies, especially in art history. The essays should include a bibliography. For further description of the portfolios, see the Undergraduate Handbook. Students are assigned semiprivate studios on the second floor of 185 Nassau. Students present their work in an exhibition at the end of the year at the Lewis Center. An “Advisers' Thesis Critique” is performed by the ART and VIS advisers in the presence of the exhibit. The grade for the senior independent work is the average of the grade given by the ART and VIS advisers during the thesis critique and for the written component.
