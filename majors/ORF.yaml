description: |-
  Operations research and financial engineering may be considered as the modern form of a liberal education: modern because it is based on science, mathematics, computing and technology, and liberal in the sense that it provides for broad intellectual development and can lead to many different types of careers. By choosing judiciously from courses in engineering, science, mathematics, economics, public policy and liberal arts, each student may design a program adapted to their particular interests.

  explanation: The core requirements (four courses). These form the intellectual foundation
    of the field and cover statistics, probability, stochastic processes, and optimization,
    along with more advanced courses in mathematical modeling.

    The departmental electives represent courses that further develop a student's skills in mathematical modeling either by a more in-depth investigation of core methodologies, applying these skills in specific areas of application, or learning about closely related technologies. Students must choose ten courses from the following list, with the following constraints:
    • There must be at least four courses from ORFE
    • There can be no more than three courses from any one department (excluding ORFE)
    
    Students often wish to follow a theme in their selection of courses. These are a few possible themes. (Note: These are extremely outdated and many courses are no longer offered)
    • Applied Mathematics: MAT 375, 378, 320; MAE 406; ORF 405

    A full-year thesis (or a one semester project plus an additional 400-level ORFE departmental) involving an application of the techniques in the program applied to a topic that the student chooses in consultation with a faculty adviser.

    Senior Thesis - ORF 478 - A full year effort that involves a major application of the techniques in the program applied to a topic that a student chooses in consultation with a faculty advisor. Students interested in a full-year senior thesis must be willing to spend the appropriate time during both the fall and the spring semesters.

    Students who are unable to make adequate progress can switch to ORF 479 and be required to take eleven departmental electives. Students will enroll in the spring and will receive credit for two course grades given in the spring.

    OR

    Senior Independent Project - ORF 479 (Spring semester only) - A short progress report will be due in January, (Dean's Date) to make sure that the students have chosen a suitable topic and matched up with their advisor. The final outcome will be a report due at the end of the spring semester. The report will fully describe the research project and its results. Typically projects will take approximately 30 to 50 pages. (Also, students who take the independent project will need to take an additional 4XX ORFE departmental elective.)
