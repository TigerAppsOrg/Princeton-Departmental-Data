description: |-
  The neuroscience major provides foundational and advanced undergraduate courses on the scientific study of the brain and biology of behavior as well as practical training in theoretical, computational and/or laboratory approaches to original neuroscience research. Students learn about different levels of analysis, from the molecular mechanisms of intercellular signaling to the formation and function of neural circuits to the generation of thought and movements via large-scale neural systems. Students also learn about cutting-edge methods in neuroscience, including laboratory techniques, computational modeling and statistics. Through their independent work, students work with faculty advisers and their teams to gain understanding of how to approach current neuroscientific problems. This work can include the generation of new data via experiments, the novel analysis of existing data sets or the formulation of new perspectives and hypotheses via the thoughtful consideration of the existing literature.

    To enter the neuroscience major, students must have completed NEU 201 Fundamentals of Neuroscience, NEU 202 Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience, and MAT 103 Calculus I.
    The first-year ISC sequence (ISC 231, 232, 233, 234) offers an alternative to the combination of MOL 214 or 215 (biology elective), COS 126 (quantitative thinking elective), and PHY 101-102 (required courses). ISC 236 Biochemistry and Neuroscience offers an alternative to NEU 201 (a prerequisite). ISC 235 Genetics and Genomics, offers an alternative to MOL 342, Genetics (and will thus count as a "biology" elective). Note: If ISC applies, please manually override.

    In the fall semester of junior year, students are required to participate in tutorials, read papers from the original literature and prepare papers on assigned topics. In the spring term, students write a research proposal with the guidance of a faculty adviser with whom they will eventually do their senior thesis.

    Students are required to present their work to two thesis readers during an oral exam. The exam usually takes about 30 minutes and students should be prepared to describe the background of the thesis, defend its contents and propose future directions. The grade for the oral defense will be the average of the two from the faculty members.
