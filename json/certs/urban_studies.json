With courses in diverse departments including anthropology, architecture, art and archaeology, history, African American studies, English, Latin American studies, Spanish and Portuguese languages and cultures, civil and environmental engineering, energy studies, sociology, politics, theater, and the High Meadows Environmental Institute, along with the School of Architecture and the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the program encourages students to think about metropolitan centers in all their complexity as physical spaces; social, cultural, political and economic nexuses; and historical artifacts.","max_common_with_major":1,"declaration_limit":8,"req_list":[{"name":"Core","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"explanation":"Students must take either URB 200 with the approval of the director, an urban-focused elective such as URB 388 in a semester in which URB 200 is not offered. Students must also take a design studio course, either  ARC 205 or ARC 204 (for students planning to major in architecture), to satisfy the core course requirements.
