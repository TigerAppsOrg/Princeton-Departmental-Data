The program emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the study of materials and the engineering application of their properties. The program is designed primarily for students in science and engineering departments who are considering careers in materials, or have general interest in materials science and engineering, although students from other disciplines, with appropriate background, may join. Participants in the program will take courses in their own department together with a group of materials courses chosen from a selected list offered by the participating departments and/or the Princeton Materials Institute. Satisfactory completion of the program is recognized by the award of a minor in materials science and engineering upon graduation.","max_common_with_major":4,"declaration_limit":6,"pdfs_allowed":0,"req_list":[{"name":"Prerequisites","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"explanation":"Take one year of general physics (PHY 103, 104, or 105, 106, or apply AP credit), one term of general chemistry with a materials focus and a laboratory (CHM 207, 215, or apply AP credit; CHM 201/202 sequence also accepted) and one year of mathematics (any two courses out of MAT 103, 104, 201, 202, 203 and 204).
