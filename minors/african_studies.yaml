description: |-
  Africa is the continent where humanity began and where its future will be determined. Princeton's minor in African Studies provides opportunities to all Princeton students, regardless of major, to learn about the continent. Students will learn a variety of methods, interdisciplinary approaches and perspectives that will enrich them with critical and analytical tools for engaging with Africa. These perspectives will aid them in their studies generally, enhancing skills used across all disciplines. The minor is devoted to the study of the Histories, Cultures, Religions, Literature, Languages, and Arts of Africa. Classes in Africa's politics, economic life, social history and ecology are offered each semester. The minor also offers classes in Africa's vibrant art scenes, past and present, where literature, music and art have come to define a new postcolonial African cosmopolitanism. Opportunities to learn Swahili and Twi are offered in the fall and spring on campus and internationally each summer. The Program in African Studies is uniquely situated to teach students ethical approaches to the study of Africa that will serve them well in all areas of study.

    Five courses are required for the minor — one core course and four electives. Students are expected to take one course in the humanities, one African language course (Twi, Ge'ez or Swahili) and one course in the social sciences (History, Politics, Sociology or Anthropology).  Any courses cross-listed with the Program in African Studies are preapproved to count toward fulfillment of the minor. Courses not cross-listed with African Studies, but devoting significant course time to issues on the continent, may be submitted for review by the program director for credit.

      explanation: |-
        The requirement of African languages can be fulfilled by one semester of an African language on campus or intense study with a summer program (SWA 103K or TWI 103G). Two courses counting toward the student's major field of concentration may also be counted (or double counted) toward fulfilling the minor in African Studies. All courses for the PAS minor must be taken for a grade, not pass/D/fail.
