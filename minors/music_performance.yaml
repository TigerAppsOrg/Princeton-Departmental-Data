description: |-
  The minor in Music Performance is a rigorous opportunity for students to study the performance of vocal and instrumental music (both jazz and classical) or conducting in the context of a liberal arts education. It provides extensive opportunities for students to hone their skills through participation in department ensembles, recitals, studio instruction and performance classes, and also requires coursework in the Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making (M&M) distribution areas. The MPP minor provides a solid foundation for students who may wish to pursue professional music training at the graduate level.

- name: Ensemble Participation
  explanation: |-
    Ensemble participation in an approved faculty-led Music Department Ensemble is required in all four semesters of the junior and senior years. The specific ensemble must be for the instrument and performance tradition for which the student was admitted. For cases in which the department does not offer a faculty-led ensemble for the instrument (e.g., classical piano, classical guitar, conducting), students may audition for a different faculty-led ensemble to fulfill the MPP minor ensemble participation requirement, or may pursue equivalent collaborative assignments as detailed on the Music Department website.

- name: Studio Lessons
  explanation: |-
    Studio lessons are required and must be taken with a Department of Music studio instructor or, if applicable, a program director. More specific parameters will differ depending on the instrument/performance practice for which the student is admitted. Students will have the option to enroll in lessons for credit (MPP298/299) if they want their work in lessons to be specifically reflected on their transcript. Students who choose to do so may NOT count this course toward completion of MPP course requirements.
