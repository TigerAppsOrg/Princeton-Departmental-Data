description: |-
  The Department of East Asian Studies offers a wide range of undergraduate classes at the highest standards of academic, linguistic and cultural competence focused on China, Japan and Korea. It provides an opportunity for students who plan to major in other disciplines to simultaneously pursue a high level of proficiency in one or more East Asian language (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) and acquire the basic knowledge about the literature, history and culture of East Asia. The student's work is supervised by the faculty members of the department, whose work covers East Asian literature, history, film and media, and anthropology. Students are also encouraged to work with other faculty members conducting research in and teaching on East Asia.

    Students placing into language courses beyond the second-year level should plan to satisfy the language course requirements for the minor with higher level courses. If there are no suitable higher level language courses available, students may seek permission from the EAS director of undergraduate studies to substitute some EAS-prefixed and cognate courses for language work.

    Students must also complete a substantial piece of research (20-25 pages) based at least in part on Chinese language sources dealing with aspects of East Asia. The topic must be in the humanities or social sciences. The paper could be either an original piece of research or a junior paper or senior thesis. If the paper or senior thesis is written for another department, at least half of the work must be on East Asia.
