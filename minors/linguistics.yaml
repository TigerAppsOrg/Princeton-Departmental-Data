description: |-
  Students at Princeton develop the skills of a linguist through hands-on engagement with gathering and interpreting data from many different languages, the employment of diverse methodologies, and the investigation of language through a variety of lenses, including:
  Working with native speakers of an unfamiliar language (Field Methods).
  Engaging with descriptive grammars and large-scale statistical correlations to investigate similarities and differences across languages (Linguistic Typology).
  Analyzing texts to elucidate how language changes over time (Historical Linguistics).
  Modeling linguistic differences across dialects and social contexts (Sociolinguistics).
  Measuring linguistic behaviors in controlled experimental contexts (Psycholinguistics).
  Observing how languages develop/coexist within speakers (Language Acquisition, Bilingualism).
  Beyond the linguistic knowledge mastered through such coursework, students of linguistics will gain a number of valuable skills that extend to nearly every domain, including: logical problem-solving, gathering and organizing large data sets, recognizing patterns, making and testing hypotheses, and identifying problems in and prospects for analytical approaches.

    Any two other LIN-designated courses at the 200 level or above (which may be drawn from the sets above). Linguistics-related courses in other departments and programs that do not have the LIN designation may be approved by the director of undergraduate program on a case-by-case basis. No more than one of these elective courses may be taken pass/D/fail. No more than one of the five courses to be completed may double-count with the student's major.

- name: Independent Work
  explanation: |-
    Some substantial aspect of linguistics should be incorporated either into the student's junior independent work or into their senior thesis. This requirement is typically met either by writing a junior paper or senior thesis on a linguistics topic or topic related to linguistics (i.e., a topic that satisfies the requirements of both the student's major and minor), or by including a chapter on a linguistics topic in a senior thesis whose general topic is not directly related to linguistics. If this is not feasible, students should contact the director of undergraduate program for alternative arrangements, which in most cases will involve writing a short piece of independent work on a topic related to linguistics, supervised by a member of the LIN faculty.
