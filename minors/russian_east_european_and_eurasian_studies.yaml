description: |-
  The program’s purpose is to provide undergraduates with expertise in a core language of Eurasia and a scholarly grounding in the study of the region. Languages applicable toward the certificate include Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian and Turkish, the last being related to most Central Asian languages as well as some in the Caucasus and in Russia.
  Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies offers preparation for government service, international business and finance, law, media, science, teaching, nongovernmental organizations and other aspects of global affairs. As such, courses from many departments count toward the minor. The program is compatible with all majors.

  explanation: |-
    Language Requirement: The minor requires students to have a minimum of one year in any of the applicable languages offered at Princeton (such as Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech, Polish, Russian, Turkish and Ukrainian) or to demonstrate a comparable level of language proficiency (typically intermediate low). Students who satisfy this requirement with a proficiency exam must take an additional course. The additional course may be a language course at or above the 105 level, or another relevant course in culture, history or politics.
