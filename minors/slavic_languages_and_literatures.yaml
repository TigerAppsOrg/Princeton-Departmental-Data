description: |-
  The Slavic department welcomes students who are interested in developing a critically informed appreciation for the literature and culture of Russia and the Slavic world. Our majors attain a high level of proficiency that allows them to work with both primary and secondary sources in the target language (BCS, Czech, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian).
  Comparable requirements will be substituted for students wishing to focus on other Slavic languages (BCS, Czech, or Polish). It is allowed to substitute the Center for Digital Humanities' course, Introduction to Data and Culture, for one of the SLA departmental courses, assuming that materials from Slavic traditions are examined.
