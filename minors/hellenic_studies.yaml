description: |-
  The minor in Hellenic Studies (HLS) aims to provide students with a thorough introduction to the history, literature, and culture of the Greek-speaking Eastern Mediterranean over the past three thousand years. This minor will allow students to engage, from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, with all aspects of Hellenism, its global encounters, and cross-cultural dialogues. At the same time, students in the Hellenic studies minor will acquire a strong grounding in the long history of this important region of the world.
