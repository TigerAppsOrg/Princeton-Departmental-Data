    Students pursuing a minor in classics choose one of two pathways. 
    These can combine courses taught in the original language and in 
    translation. Each pathway requires the completion of five courses, 
    four of which must be CLA, CLG 108 or above, or LAT 108 or above. 
    The fifth can be a relevant course offered in another department 
    approved by the DUS.
