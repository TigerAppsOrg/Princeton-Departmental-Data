- name: Journalism Practice
  explanation: |-
    Journalism Practice (either fieldwork experience or an independent writing project): Students must participate in sustained journalistic activity for a minimum of six weeks, whether working within an approved news organization or writing an independent creative nonfiction project. The practice should involve reporting, interviewing, researching and writing and may also involve copyediting, web design, photography, videography, data analysis, etc. Examples include interning at a major news organization, working for an approved student journalism organization, undertaking an independent reporting and writing project advised by a Princeton faculty member, or successfully completing an intensive summer journalism seminar abroad. To fulfill this requirement, students must obtain approval for their proposed journalistic practice from the program director.
    Students may only integrate their journalism practice writing (fieldwork or independent project), or their senior colloquium presentation, with independent work in their major with the express prior approval of both their director of undergraduate studies and the director of the Program in Journalism.
