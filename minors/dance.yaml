  The Program in Dance, part of the Lewis Center for the Arts, 
  welcomes all students to engage and experiment with dance. At the 
  core of the program is the belief that dance fosters an integration 
  of mind and body that allows for a greater connection to ourselves 
  and our communities. To that end, the dance minor offers students deep 
  exposure to and appreciation of dance through practice, performance and 
  critical conversation.

  explanation: |-
    Students should enroll in the minor program during the second term of 
    sophomore year, but no later than the start of the first term of 
    junior year. We recommend that students complete at least two of the 
    required courses before enrollment in the minor program.

    Complete five DAN courses, including: at least one studio course 
    at least one seminar course in dance studies, for example: DAN 215, 
    321 or another research-based scholarly course with approval of 
    the director of dance. The range of required courses allows for 
    students to focus their studies on performance, choreography, 
    dance scholarship, or to create an interdisciplinary focus. 
    Independent work is not required to receive a minor in dance. 
    Students interested in pursuing independent research in their 
    senior year must meet specific course requirements, and the 
    substitution of requirements, if necessary, will be made with the 
    approval of the director of dance.

- name: Dance Program Production Support
  explanation: |-
    All students planning to earn the minor in dance must complete the 
    show support requirement (formerly referred to as “tech hours”) by 
    supporting one dance program show in a nonperforming capacity. 
    Students who will propose an independent choreographic or 
    performance project during their senior year must have completed 
    the show support requirement by the end of their junior year. 
    Through supporting dance program shows, students will get to know 
    the dance program's students and staff, our venues and our practices, 
    and will be better prepared for independent projects.
