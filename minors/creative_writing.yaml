  The Program in Creative Writing, part of the Lewis Center for the Arts, 
  with a minor in creative writing, like our present certificate students, 
  will encounter a rigorous framework of courses. These courses are designed, 
  first and foremost, to teach the students how to read like a writer, 
  thoughtfully, artistically, curiously, with an open mind attuned to the 
  nuances of any human situation. This skill is not only for students who 
  plan to be professional writers, but most important, this is a skill we 
  believe to be crucial for all students. The many courses offered by the
  creative writing department teach students how to structure a narrative
  and write it well; how to use lived experience in the compressed linguistic 
  construct of a poem so that it provides a meaningful experience for a reader; 
  how to think about, and undertake, the translation of a literary work into 
  another literary work in another language; how to write and adapt literary 
  narratives for a variety of screen media.

    For the minor program, our goal is to guide students through a 
    course of study that begins with introductory courses, and then 
    combines courses at advanced levels with cross-listed and approved 
    courses offered by other units. The minor in creative writing 
    includes a total of five courses, three of which must be housed in 
    creative writing, and two which may be cross-listed with creative 
    writing. To be eligible to apply for the minor, students must have 
    taken the five courses as described below by the end of their 
    junior year. Senior year is focused on development of students' 
    independent work.

  explanation: |-
    Students admitted to the minor program will have one year of 
    one-on-one thesis work with an established poet or prose writer. 
    This independent work includes weekly or biweekly conferences with 
    the thesis advisers for two semesters. Under the direction of the 
    thesis advisers, the students will produce a full-length collection 
    of poetry, a collection of short stories or a finished novel 
    manuscript. Each final thesis is read by another writer, who 
    provides a thoughtful and detailed commentary, which gives a 
    snapshot of the student's career and offers future direction. 
    This independent thesis work has long been a treasured tradition of 
    the creative writing program, and we believe that the conversion to 
    the minor program will more accurately reflect the amount of work 
    both the students and the advisers have put in during their senior 
    year. Apart from independent work, the students will also participate 
    in two public readings — a reading of their work-in-progress with 
    their peers alongside a published writer, and a thesis reading, 
    a celebration of their final theses. An unofficial monthly lunch 
    meeting for the thesis cohort, directed by an appointed faculty 
    member, will serve as a support group.
