description: >-
  The A.B. program at Princeton is intended to stretch students' minds and
  challenge their imaginations — to teach them to think and reason and document
  and prove, to cast a critical eye on conventional wisdom, to make sense of
  evidence, to read a text with care and critical insight, to conceptualize and
  solve problems, and to express themselves clearly and convincingly on paper
  and in discussion. Working within the general curricular framework, each
  undergraduate pursuing the A.B. degree is encouraged to develop an academic
  program in response to personal aspirations and interests. Each student's
  program of study encompasses a combination of courses that satisfy general
  education and departmental requirements, and substantial independent work
  during the junior and senior years.

    explanation: >-
      With the exception of students who receive one or two terms of advanced
      standing, all A.B. students must successfully complete a minimum of 31
      courses and two years of departmental independent work in eight terms of
      study.  A student who has been required to withdraw for academic reasons
      will, in most cases, be required to repeat the unsatisfactory term in
      order to meet the basic graduation requirement of eight successfully
      completed terms of study.

      The normal course load for first-years, sophomores, and juniors is four
      courses each term, with the exception of one term in the first or
      sophomore year when a student typically will need to take five courses in
      order to meet the expectation that 17 courses will have been completed by
      the start of junior year.

      Regardless of the number of courses completed prior to entering senior
      year, all seniors must, with the exception of the two programs listed
      below, complete a minimum of six courses in senior year. This is most
      often accomplished by enrolling in three courses each term but students
      may take four courses in one term and two courses in the other. Students
      in the Program in Teacher Preparation who have taken an extra course in an
      earlier year or a student who is participating in the University Scholar
      Program may be permitted to reduce their course load by one course in the
      senior year.

      The ability to write English clearly and precisely is a University
      requirement that must be satisfied by completing a writing seminar in the
      first year. The writing seminar does not count as one of the seven
      humanities and social science courses.

      The Writing Seminars give Princeton first-year students an early
      opportunity to belong to a lively academic community in which members
      investigate a shared topic and discuss their writing together, with the
      aim of clarifying and deepening their thinking. The seminars are
      interdisciplinary in nature to emphasize transferable reading, writing and
      research skills. You'll learn how to frame compelling questions, position
      your argument within a genuine academic debate, substantiate and organize
      claims, purposefully integrate a wide variety of sources and revise for
      greater cogency and clarity.

    explanation: >-
      Proficiency in a language other than English is required for graduation
      under the A.B. program. Many undergraduates satisfy the language
      requirement by demonstrating proficiency when they enter the University;
      proficiency is demonstrated by documenting the results of AP tests or SAT
      Subject Tests, or by taking placement tests administered by academic
      departments at Princeton. Those tests can also determine whether a student
      is eligible to elect advanced courses (200 and 300 level). See the
      individual department entries for further information.

      Language study for students who don't demonstrate proficiency as described
      above is required through successful completion on a graded basis of
      courses normally numbered 107 (or 108) in a language taken at Princeton,
      or through demonstration of an equivalent level of competence (for
      instance, by completing an upper-level course that has been determined to
      require language proficiency at or above the 107 level as a prerequisite).

      When an undergraduate begins a language at Princeton, three or four terms
      of study will usually be necessary.  If continuing a language begun
      elsewhere, the student is placed at an appropriate level.

    explanation: >-
      The requirement in Culture and Difference begins with the premise that
      human beings experience the world through their respective cultures — the
      ideas, meanings, norms, and habituations — that are represented in the
      arts and literature, laws and institutions, and social practices of human
      societies whose histories and power relationships often differ from one
      another.  Found across a wide range of disciplines, these courses use
      cultural analysis to trace the ways in which human beings construct
      meaning both within and across groups. Culture and Difference courses
      offer students a lens through which other forms of disciplinary inquiry
      are enhanced, critiqued, and clarified, often paying close attention to
      the experiences and perspectives of groups who have historically been
      excluded from dominant cultural narratives or structures of social power.
      The requirement in Culture and Difference is the only requirement that may
      be satisfied either independently or concurrently with another
      distribution area.

    explanation: >-
      Courses in Epistemology and Cognition address the nature and limits of
      human knowledge.  The cognitive sciences and related fields study human
      reasoning as it is. Epistemology — the philosophical theory of knowledge —
      studies human reasoning as it ought to be.  Both areas of inquiry focus
      simultaneously on the manifold sources of human knowledge and on the many
      ways in which human reasoning can be distorted or undermined. Courses in
      this group are offered in a number of departments, but share the common
      goal of encouraging students to reflect on the linguistic, psychological,
      and cultural structures that make knowledge possible. Individual
      departments may also offer courses in disciplinary “ways of knowing” that
      invite students to consider the epistemological assumptions and
      methodological principles that inform research in their fields.

    explanation: >-
      Human beings often disagree about matters of right and wrong, and about
      how we ought to organize our lives together. The ethical and moral
      conclusions we reach, however, are not mere matters of opinion. Ethical
      decisions emerge from fundamental ideas about the nature and possibility
      of the “good,” our duties and obligations to one another, our aspirations
      for a virtuous and meaningful life, and the demands of justice.  These
      ideas, often shaped by ancient traditions of religion and culture, guide
      the moral questions we ask and the conclusions we reach. Courses in
      Ethical Thought and Moral Values equip students to understand the basis of
      their own moral reasoning and ethical issues as they arise in social life,
      while also cultivating the possibility of a common ethical language among
      people whose traditions and values differ.

    max_counted: 1
    explanation: >-
      Historical analysis invites students to enter imaginatively into
      languages, institutions, and worldviews of the past.  It grounds us in the
      awareness that human life and culture are thousands of years old, and that
      the world we experience in the present is only a fraction of all that it
      ever was.  Fundamental to historical analysis is the study of change over
      time:  why and how did cities rise and fall, technologies develop, social
      roles transform?  Because we can never directly experience the past,
      historical analysis depends on the subjective selection and interpretation
      of texts, artifacts, and other evidence, and from the same evidence many
      different stories can often be told. Historical analysis requires students
      to make critical judgments about the conclusions we can draw from the
      traces of the past to which we have access.

    explanation: >-
      Human beings have always used imagination to create reflections and
      representations of ourselves and our world, from cave paintings to
      symphonies to video games. In making these artistic or imaginative
      representations, we express ideas about our own nature and investigate the
      nature of the world around us, often in ways that push at the boundaries
      of what can be said in ordinary language. In courses in Literature and the
      Arts, students may produce creative, imaginative works or practice
      interpreting them. For example, they may choreograph dances or read
      Shakespeare's plays or create performance pieces that use imaginative and
      interpretive skills critically and physically. The skill of “close
      reading” is especially important in this area of inquiry: what can we
      learn from careful attention to the precise words, colors, or tones that
      an artist has chosen?

    explanation: >-
      Social analysis involves the study of the structures, processes, and
      meanings human beings create through our interactions with one another,
      and the networks and institutions through which human behavior develops
      and evolves. The codes and narratives we share with others, often
      unspoken, produce our sense of “the normal” and structure our thought and
      behavior. These components of social life are accessible through both
      quantitative methods, which involve the statistical analysis of data, and
      qualitative methods, which rely on the interpretation of data gathered
      through observation and interaction.  Social analysis enables us to make
      sense of the social structures and processes that shape individual lives,
      to understand the role of institutions — such as the family, government,
      schools, and labor markets — in society, and to define and respond to
      social problems, such as inequality and violence.

    explanation: >-
      Quantitative and computational reasoning engages students in the logic of
      mathematics and the manipulation of numerical and categorical
      information.  Quantitative reasoning asks us to describe and predict
      things that can be measured or counted such as population, speed, or cost.
      Computational thinking informs the underlying structures of the codes and
      algorithms created in computer science. Quantitative and computational
      reasoning is used to some degree in almost every area of learning.  A
      strong foundation in quantitative reasoning helps students think clearly
      and apply quantitative methods to a wide range of projects, and equips
      them to critically evaluate statistical claims.

      Science and engineering encompass the study of the natural and constructed
      worlds, their impact on humanity, and the human impact on them. These
      disciplines teach principles, methods, and systematic thinking, how to
      innovate theories and methodologies, how to test hypotheses and prototypes
      by analyzing data while managing uncertainty, and how to enhance the built
      world through creativity and design. Fundamental to science and
      engineering are the methods and habits of mind in which models are
      developed, critiqued, and refined, thereby enriching and expanding our
      ways of understanding — and fascination with — the natural and constructed
      environments, and our own positions within them. 

      At least one course must be a science and engineering course with

      laboratory (SEL). Students may elect a second laboratory science course,
      or a nonlaboratory science course (SEN).
