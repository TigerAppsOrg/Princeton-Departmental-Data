  The Program in Humanistic Studies is a minor about major questions: What is it
  to be human? What do we do with our humanity? How do we experience difference
  and what role does it play in the good life? How do tradition and
  transformation make our lives deeper and more dynamic? We address these
  questions by inviting students to reflect explicitly on the theory and
  practice of disciplines and to build bridges among them.

          Two of the four courses must be taken at the 300 or 400 level. The
          capstone seminar for the minor, HUM 470, Interdisciplinary Studies in
          the Humanities, is highly recommended as one of these two courses.
          This team-taught course varies from year to year, depending on the
          focus of the faculty teams. These courses are a site of innovation and
          experimentation, offering cutting-edge, hands-on experience with new
          constellations of texts, objects and images. Designed specifically for
          HUM minors, the seminars have wide appeal, and seats are always
          reserved for HUM minors.

          clusters, which demonstrate the broad reach of the humanities. Each
          semester, students will be furnished with a list of preapproved
          courses for each cluster and the specific HUM courses and HUM
          cross-lists included in each; some courses will appear in more than
          one cluster.

              the possible combinations of religion, philosophy, history,
              literature and the creative arts. They pay attention to the
              landmark achievements in an intellectual tradition, considering
              continuities as well as societal change, upheaval and
              transformation.

              Illuminating their study of one culture with comparative
              approaches to other areas of the world, these courses investigate
              one or more regions through various methodologies. To enhance
              their intercultural studies, program students have benefited from
              participating in global seminars or other study abroad
              opportunities.
