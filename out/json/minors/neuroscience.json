The certificate in neuroscience has been serving this function since 2006, but since neuroscience now has a major, transitioning the certificate to a minor is appropriate. The PNI faculty believe that the current requirements of the NEU certificate are sufficient for a minor and have endorsed changing the name without modifications to the requirements. The requirements for the NEU minor are all related to coursework. There is no independent work requirement for the neuroscience certificate.","max_common_with_major":null,"declaration_limit":4,"excluded_majors":["NEU"],"req_list":[{"name":"Introductory Courses","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"course_list":["NEU 200","NEU 202"]},{"name":"Electives","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"double_counting_allowed":true,"explanation":"In addition to the two prerequisites, all students are expected to take at least four neuroscience electives from three out of four subject areas.
