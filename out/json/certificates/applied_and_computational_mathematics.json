The combination of mathematics and computer modeling has transformed science and engineering and is changing the nature of research in the biological sciences, data science and many other areas. Students seeking to pursue an academic program with a strong focus on applied mathematics may major in mathematics with a course of study geared toward applications, or may major in the sciences or engineering and enroll in the certificate Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM).","max_common_with_major":3,"declaration_limit":5,"pdfs_allowed":0,"req_list":[{"name":null,"min_needed":"Program of Study","max_counted":1,"explanation":"A total of five courses, normally 300-level or higher (requires letter grade; pass/D/fail not accepted), at least two of which are not included in the usual requirements for the candidate's major.\nThe course requirement may be satisfied by a broad range of courses that place a particular emphasis on applied mathematics, which are offered by the mathematics department as well as the science, engineering and economics departments. The five required courses must be distributed between the following two areas, with at least two from each area: \n1. Mathematical foundations and techniques, including differential equations, real and complex analysis, discrete mathematics, probability, numerical methods, etc. \n2. Mathematical applications in diverse areas offered by the applied and computational mathematics program and by science, engineering and economics departments.","req_list":[{"name":"Foundations and Techniques","min_needed":2,"max_counted":3,"course_list":["MAT 3**","MAT 4**","MAT 5**","APC 350","APC 503","APC 501","APC 506","APC 523","APC 527","AST 301","CBE 448","CEE 532","COS 323","COS 340","ECE 486","ECE 525","ECE 528","MAE 305","MAE 306","MAE 503","MAE 541","MAE 542","ORF 307","ORF 309","ORF 363","ORF 523","ORF 526","PHY 521","PHY 523","QCB 511"],"excluded_course_list":["MAT 323"]},{"name":"Applications","min_needed":2,"max_counted":3,"course_list":["AOS 571","AOS 572","AOS 573","AOS 576","APC 490","APC 509","APC 514","APC 524","CBE 341","CEE 361","CHM 305","CHM 306","CHM 405","CHM 406","COS 324","COS 343","COS 402","COS 423","COS 424","COS 426","COS 429","COS 433","COS 445","COS 451","COS 487","COS 511","COS 522","COS 533","COS 557","ECO 312","ECO 317","ECO 414","ECO 418","ECO 465","ECO 466","ECO 481","ECO 513","EEB 324","EEB 325","EEB 424","ECE 381","ECE 382","ECE 482","ECE 488","ECE 521","ECE 523","ECE 530","ECE 535","GEO 371","GEO 422","GEO 424","GEO 425","GEO 441","GEO 557","MAE 335","MAE 336","MAE 433","MAE 434","MAE 545","MAE 546","MAE 552","MAE 559","MAT 323","MOL 436","MSE 515","NEU 437","ORF 335","ORF 350","ORF 387","ORF 405","ORF 407","ORF 435","ORF 473","PHY 304","PHY 305","PHY 408","PHY 509","PHY 525","PHY 562","POL 572","POL 573","QCB 408","QCB 515"]}]},{"name":"Independent Work","max_counted":1,"explanation":"Independent work consisting of a paper in one of the following formats: (a) a project that you are working on with a professor; or (b) a summer research project.

In particular, you may not use your junior paper or senior thesis to satisfy the independent work requirement for the certificate. A significant extension of the senior thesis or of a course project may however be used to satisfy the requirement, subject to approval of the PACM undergraduate representative.\nStudents are required to participate during the spring semester of their junior and senior years in a not-for-credit colloquium offered by PACM. This will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of independent work among all certificate students and will introduce them to a broad range of areas within applied mathematics.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null}]}
