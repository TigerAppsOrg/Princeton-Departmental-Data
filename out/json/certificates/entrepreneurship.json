The program has three main aims: to create focused pathways through the curriculum that will allow Princeton undergraduates to supplement work in their major departments with a systematic and coherent understanding of, and practice in, entrepreneurship; to leverage, expand and enhance the University's offerings across the liberal arts in order to fulfill the previously stated aim; and to promote an interdisciplinary academic community of undergraduate students, faculty members and others who share an interest in and commitment to learning from and contributing to these areas.","max_common_with_major":null,"declaration_limit":5,"pdfs_allowed":null,"excluded_majors":[null],"req_list":[{"name":"Introductory Courses","min_needed":2,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"Two common introductory courses: EGR 200/ENT 200 and EGR 201/ENT 201","course_list":["EGR 200","EGR 201"]},{"name":"Core Courses","min_needed":2,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"Two core courses: must be chosen from a list, which may be updated each year by the Executive Committee","course_list":["ANT 300","ANT 302","ART 106","COS 448","EGR 219","EGR 301","EGR 348","EGR 383","EGR 395","EGR 487","EGR 491","EGR 495","EGR 497","EGR 498","HIS 379"]},{"name":"Breadth Course","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"One contextual breadth course: to be chosen from a list of suggestions or be proposed by students to the program director.

These are short-term one-off or sessional workshops, normally 3-12 hours in duration, and students will be required to complete at least one of their choice.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null},{"name":"Practicum","max_counted":1,"explanation":"Entrepreneurs, however smart they are and whatever ventures they pursue, are, above all, doers. They apply their ideas and learning to try to create value for their customers, investors, colleagues, themselves, and hopefully our society. They challenge the status quo.\nThis practicum is intended to give students the opportunity to fulfill their version of that endeavor — a significant firsthand practical experience in seeing what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur in whatever context is most meaningful to them. \nIt is not intended as a theoretical undertaking but a hands-on exposure to the reality of the entrepreneurial odyssey, whether that unfolds in a Silicon Valley-type high-tech setting or a rural village or underserved urban community someplace. Accordingly, the practicum should expose students to key elements of that odyssey, such as customer discovery, design thinking, solution prototyping, team assembly or market validation — efforts that test and refine hypotheses about what's required to create a financially viable, worthwhile venture.\nOPTIONS: There are five primary options for the practicum, each designed with the above objectives in mind. Any of these can provide the experiential foundation for the required paper and presentation:\nEntrepreneurial Engagement\nStartup Launch\nSolution Development\nFrontline Insights\nWild Card\nStudents should consult the program website for more information about each of the five options.\nA junior paper, senior thesis or other form of independent coursework does not by itself satisfy the practicum requirement. However, these efforts may facilitate students' work to design a related experience and analytical agenda that does.\nJuniors will explain their proposed practicum in the form of a poster presentation at the Keller Center's Colloquium in the spring semester.\nSeniors have two final deliverables for their practicum:\na ten-page paper (due two weeks before the colloquium); and\na five-minute formal oral presentation to a group of reviewers at the colloquium itself.\nStudents can expect detailed feedback on their pass-fail “stand and deliver” summary from at least one Keller Center faculty member in addition to their adviser.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null},{"name":"Colloquium","max_counted":1,"explanation":"Students are required to present their practicum, or a combination of their academic work and practicum, at least twice before graduation.\nThe required sequence is:\nApril/May of junior year: Practicum proposal presented as a poster at the certificate's annual colloquium.\nApril of senior year: Written analysis presented to evaluation committee no less than two weeks before annual colloquium.\nApril/May of senior year: Oral presentation of practicum at the certificate's annual colloquium.\nThis social event also serves to foster community and conversation among the certificate students. The mentorship of faculty in certain practicing opportunities and of alumni in others will also help to build a greater sense of interaction across the Princeton community of people with entrepreneurial interests.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null}]}
