description: |-
  New industries and organizations depend increasingly on the interplay between engineering, computing and the life sciences. Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, in topics that may not be covered by a single department. The program offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest and setting the stage for further achievement. Students are encouraged to expand their experience through summer internships with companies, government agencies and university laboratories.

- name: Independent Work
  explanation: |-
    A one-term senior independent work project or two-term senior thesis whose topic is relevant to robotics and intelligent systems must be completed and presented to the program committee. Junior independent work projects do not fulfill the certificate requirement. A minimum grade of B- for the project or thesis is required to qualify for the certificate.
