description: |-
  For the final year, AAS offers a certificate in African American Studies for students majoring in another department. Students may apply for formal admission to the certificate program at any time once they have taken and achieved satisfactory standing in any AAS course.  
  The Program in African American Studies was founded on the assumption that the study of African American history and culture, and of the role that race has played in shaping the life and the institutions of the United States, is central to an American liberal education. Given the continuing and evolving centrality of race in American political, economic, social and cultural life, and indeed, in every region of the world, reflection on race and on the distinctive experiences of Black people is indispensable for all Princeton students as global citizens. Drawing on a core of distinguished faculty in areas such as art and archaeology, comparative literature, English, history, philosophy, law and political science, psychology, religion and sociology, the program promotes teaching and research of race with a focus on the experience of African Americans in the United States.
  AAS offers an undergraduate certificate that expands and deepens a student's understanding of race in the United States and in the world. Earning a certificate is straightforward and allows students to experience an enriching course of study that complements any Princeton major. Students who opt to pursue a certificate gain access to an extraordinary bibliography that prepares them to think about race and power in sophisticated ways. Students are trained in the methods, themes and ideas that inform interdisciplinary scholarship, with a particular focus on race and racial inequality.
