description: |-
  The Certificate Program in Optimization and Quantitative Decision Science (OQDS) is focused on developing quantitative skills for optimal decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. Through this certificate program, students will learn to quantify risk and uncertainty, and to view any complex decision through the lens of mathematical optimization. This outlook will give them a more structured understanding of the decision itself, as they learn to rigorously formulate their constraints, objective functions(s) and the uncertainties involved. It will also lead students to the proper algorithmic tools that are needed to arrive at an optimal decision.

  explanation: |-
    A senior thesis or project must be completed and submitted to the program director (oqds@princeton.edu) that demonstrates a command of some portion of the core disciplines of uncertainty analysis and/or optimization. Students in engineering departments that require a one-semester project can typically use a suitably designed project to satisfy the requirement.
    Acceptable theses can be on a wide range of topics, but they must demonstrate a command of the core disciplines of the OQDS certificate program, including stochastics and/or optimization. The thesis must demonstrate, in appropriate mathematics, the ability to model a problem and perform analysis that leads to some conclusion or scientific result. A thesis with minimal or no mathematical modeling is not acceptable.
    Theses that are not allowed include "soft" topics such as the history of a nation's economy, and hard-science theses (laboratory-based theses) that do not have a significant modeling or data-analysis component (for example, collecting observations and computing basic statistics is not sufficient).
